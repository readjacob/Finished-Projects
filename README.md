In this repository are a couple of files containing code I've written for
several projects. The system UGA uses to have is students write and submit
code for class projects does not have an easy way to copy directories to 
GitHub so the applications will not run automatically, but the code they
contain along with the descriptions below should provide an overview of what
they were intended to do and how they work.

Application Of Sorting Algorithms to Data Structures:

This program for my Data Structures class takes in a text file containing numbers
as an input and creates a LinkedList to hold them. The user is then queried about
which sorting algorithm to use: Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort (Fixed Pivot), 
or Quick Sort (Random Pivot). After selection, the list sorted and then the number
of comparisons need to sort the list according to that algorithm is displayed.

Gallery:

This program is designed to create a basic application with a UI that allows the user
to enter a search term. That term is then used to search the iTunes library. The results
are processed and then a certain number of the album covers associated with the results
are displayed. If there are more results than there is room for images, the images cycle
with a new image randomly replacing one of the previously displayed periodicly.

Shell:

This program for my Systems Programming class is designed to be the code for an executable
function from a terminal that would display another limited-function terminal within the terminal.
